RecipeScraper - meal planning made simple

The motivation for this project is fueled by the need to cram meal planning and grocery shopping into a busy schedule.
Not many individuals prefer to cook "from scratch" by throwing together whatever's available to them from the pantry
on a given day. They're either highly skilled, or they're unwilling to invest time in looking up recipes and compiling
shopping lists for following those recipes. The majority of us who prefer to follow such recipes suffer from the
same predicament. That's why we resort to sticking with what we know - it saves time. There's no need to spend hours
looking up recipes, and compiling a shopping list isn't nearly as difficult. Heck, you might have even memorized the 
recipes and ingredients lists. 

Why not mix up the meal plan on any given week with a couple of new dishes? It's a matter of having time.
The objectivity of recipe scraping is to extract useful information from various cooking websites, so that such
info can be utilized to make shopping lists, conveniently display cooking steps, and much more.

In this project, a number of tools/languages will be experimented with. For one, recipe scraping or scraping in general
may turn out to be easier depending on the available libraries. It's also important to consider that recipe scraping
in and of itself is not a complete product - the scraper should be easily integrated into a web or mobile app. If
the app does not support executing code in Python for instance, that could be troublesome. Although, in that example,
it's possible to deploy the scraper as a web service that supports Python and to provide an API that apps can hook into.

The focus for now is to find a methodology that works and hope that the method can be adapted for integration into
an application.
